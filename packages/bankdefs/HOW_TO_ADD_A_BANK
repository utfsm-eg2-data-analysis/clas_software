Here are some brief instructions how to update banks:

1) The master copies of all ddl files are stored in
packages/bankdefs under cvs control. Each BOS bank has its own
.ddl file. 

2) To update the list of ddl files used by all CLAS software,
all of the short .ddl files for single bos banks are merged into 
a file called clasbanks.ddl the simplest way to do this is with the
cat command:
	cat `ls ????.ddl ???.ddl ??.ddl` > clasbanks.ddl

3) The file clasbanks.ddl should then be copied over to the
CLAS_PARMS area where it can be used by recsis and other
programs that need access to the list of CLAS BOS banks.

4) In addition the script ddl2h should be run on the file
clasbanks.ddl and the file bosddl.h should be updated for use in
the c_bos_io library. The command should be:
	ddl2h clasbanks.ddl > ../include/bosddl.h
The new bosddl.h file should then be commited to cvs as well.

Let me say that I think the librarian should do points 2) and
3)  and  4) . The most important
step is to put a copy of your ddl file into the repostiory - so we
have a record of it and the bank definition is in a place where it
will propogate into the offline software. Finally, multiple ddl files should
be avoided and the files in the CLAS_PARMS area should never
be directly edited.
