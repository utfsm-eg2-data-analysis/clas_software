<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Working with BOS banks in C</H3>

<P>During the past few months Maurik Holtrop and I have been developing
(off and on) a library of C routines designed to provide a easy way of
working with BOS banks in C. The package currently resides in cvs under
packages/c_bos_io. I am writing this note because several people have asked
me about it, asked for something like it, or have started writing something
very much like it themselves. I hope to create a uniform C + BOS environment
and to avoid duplication of effort, so people interested in this should
provide comments or modify the code during the next few weeks while the
code is still flexible - to help us create a package we all can use.</P>

<P>The essential idea of the package is that each BOS bank has a C data
structure associated with it. The C structures are obtained by parsing
the .ddl files with an existing Perl script. Calls are then defined that
instead of returning an index into the BOS common they return a pointer
to a structure. This makes BOS banks extremely easy to work with directly,
avoiding the common practice of copying the contents of the BOS bank to
a temporary array, and makes the code extremely easy to read.</P>

<P>The structure for each BOS bank is defined by a bank header followed
by an array of structures containing the contents of the BOS bank. The
bank header mirrors the information preceding the contents of each BOS
bank. The bank header is the same for all banks and is defined below, the
source is located in packages/include/bostypes.h:</P>

<P>typedef struct {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int ncol;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int nrow;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char name[4];<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int nr;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int nextIndex;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int nwords;<BR>
} bankHeader_t;</P>

<P>Structures are then defined for each of the BOS banks. This structure
contains a bankHeader_t followed by an array of structures containing the
contents of the BOS bank. The naming convention is clas(BANKNAME)_t for
the main bank and (bankname)_t for the array of structures. An example
of a simple bank (DC0) is shown below:</P>

<P>typedef struct {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bankHeader_t bank;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dc0_t dc0[1];<BR>
} clasDC0_t;</P>

<P>Where dc0_t is shown below;</P>

<P>typedef struct {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uint16 id; /* the address of the hit detector element
*/<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uint16 tdc; /* tdc information (channels) */<BR>
} dc0_t;</P>

<P>where uint16 is an unsigned short.</P>

<P>Several utilities have been written in the c_bos_io library to use these
structures, the most fundamental is the function call getBank which returns
a pointer to a structure when one asks for a bank of a particular name.
A short example of code which would print the entire contents of the first
DC0 bank is shown below:</P>

<P>int i;<BR>
clasDC0_t *DCbank;</P>

<P>if(DCbank = (clasDC0_t *)getBank(&amp;bcs_,&quot;DC0 &quot;)){<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf(&quot;Bank Name:%s, Number of entries: %d\n&quote;,
DCbank-&gt;bank.name, &nbsp;DCbank-&gt;bank.nrow);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(i=0; i &lt; DCbank-&gt;bank.nrow; i++)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf(&quot;id: %d, tdc: %d\n&quot;,
DCbank-&gt;dc0[i].id, DCbank-&gt;dc0[i].tdc);<BR>
} else { <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf(&quot;No DC0 bank found\n&quot;);<BR>
}</P>

<P>That's it! A few comments: &amp;bcs_ is a pointer to the BOS common,
the return value getBank is a pointer to void which must be cast to the
appropriate type, and if getBank fails to find a bank it returns NULL.</P>

<P>Routines also exist to make banks, drop banks, initialize BOS, open/close
files and sequentially read a file. The prototypes for these routines exist
in packages/include/bostypes.h. A simple program called bosdump prints
to stdout the contents of BOS banks using these utilities, and provides
a nice template for using this library. bosdump is located in packages/utilities/bosdump
a web page also exists for c_bos_io under software libraries in the clas
Off-Line pages:</P>

<P>I believe the benefits of utilities like these are obvious, I also strongly
feel that we should agree on one library of C routines to interface with
BOS - this will make everyone's code easier to read, easier to maintain,
it will avoid duplication of effort and will allow us all to build on each
other's work. The exact implementation of these routines is still somewhat
up for grabs as not a lot of code has been written using them - however
this will quickly change as more code is written, and it will become more
and more costly to change the package - so I would urge people interested
in this library to provide comments.</P>
