<H3>What the Vertex Routines Do</H3>
   The purpose of the vertex routines are twofold: first, define the best 
possible vertex for all tracks, and second identify detached vertices.
The routines assume that the magnetic field is negligible in the vicinity of 
the target and that straight line approximations for the track will work.  
There are two different sets of vertex routines, those that make the 
<A href="#VERT">VERT bank</A>, and those that make the 
<A href="#MVRT">MVRT bank</A>.

<hr>
<H3> <A name = "VERT"> The VERT banks </A></H3>
The VERT bank is based upon several simplifying assumptions, first that 
the tracks are straight lines, and second, that the vertex is the point 
that is halfway between two of these straight lines.
In the first VERT bank, each track is matched with the beam-line.  
In the second bank, each 
track is matched with all other tracks such that all possible pairs of tracks 
are analyzed.  Note that this means for events with more than two tracks that
each track will be a part of more than one vertex.   
The two VERT banks contain the following information (from vert.ddl):

<h4>Using the VERT Routines</h4>
To make the VERT bank,  vertex_brun(int runno) must first be run to 
initialize the beamline location then for each event, 
make_vert() should be called, which at present requires the 
existance of either the TBTR or HBTR banks.
The routine takes two tracks (or one track and the beam line) and finds 
the point midway on the shortest line segment between the two.  That vertex 
is stored in a vector3_t (which has the x,y,z coordinates) and trk1 and trk2 
are used to store the id number of the tracks used from the HBTR or TBTR bank. 
A value of 0 represents the beam-line.  The length of the line segment is 
stored in sepd. VERT bank 1 consists of only tracks matched to the beamline, 
whereas VERT bank 2 consists of all possible pairs of tracks.  the 
<A href="#MVRT">MVRT</A> bank should probably now be used instead of 
VERT bank 2.

<hr>
<H3> <A name = "MVRT"> The MVRT banks </A></H3>
The MVRT banks are the results of a multi-track vertex fitting routine that 
uses the information from the TBER bank.  A least squared fit is done on 
the vertex location, minimizing the distance to each track, weighted by the 
appropriate error from the Covariancce matrix of each track.  The algorithem 
used is described in <u> Statistical and Computation Methods in Datas 
Analysis</u> by Siegmund Brandt.  The MVRT bank is made using all the 
tracks in the event.  The ddl file looks like:

<h4>Using the MVRT Routines</h4>
To make the MVRT bank,  vertex_brun(int runno) must first be run to 
initialize the beamline location then for each event, make_mvrt() 
should be called.  This requires the existance of the TBER bank.
The routine takes all tracks and reports back the best vertex in 
the vector3_t vert.  The absolute chi2 is reported as well as the 
covariance matrix array elements (which are symmetric).  Note that 
this is not the normalized chi2 and also that the elements of the 
covariance matrtix are proportional to the errors reported in tracking, 
so if you double the value of all the covarinace matrix elements of the 
tracks, the covariance matrix of the vertex will double.  At present, it 
seeems like the errors reported in the TBER banks are too small.
ntrk is the number of tracks used to make the vertex, and in all cases this 
should be the same as the number of tracks in the TBER bank.
The purpose of v_id is for use when different combinations of tracks are used 
to find a detached vertex.  
It is defined as the sum over all tracks used of 2 raised to the 
track number(1-10).  The beamline is given a track number of 0, a;though this 
is not implemented yet.
In other words, each 1 bit represents a track used in making the vertex: 
For two tracks
(1 and 2) v_id = 6, for three (0(the beamline),1,and 2) the value is 7,and for 9 tracks + the beamline (0,1,2,3,...9) v_id= 2^10-1.
A value less than 2 means that only one track was used, and the position 
returned was the point of closest approach of that track to the beamline, in 
which case the errors reported are the square of the elements of the vector 
to the beamline(as stored in the map)
(ie Cxx= dx*dx, Cyy= dy*dy, Czz=dz*dz, and all off-diagonal elements are = 0).
note that this is slightly different from the VERT 
bank which reports the point halfway between the two.  

<h3>Future Work</h3>
There are a few minor changes that need to be done in routines beneath 
make_mvrt().  the service routine mtv(..) needs to have one extra parameter 
added to allow the information about the suggested change to the track 
parameters to be passed up, 
and possibly a new bank should be made about what these 
suggested changes are.  
Also routines that use the mtv(...) routine to identify detached
vertecies need to be written.  neither of these changes should effect how 
make_mvrt is called or used.
