# This text file is read by both RunJob, ProcessRun, and makeSub in
# order to set the environmental variables needed for a consistent 
# production cooking. The file should contain the below set of environment
# variable names followed by their definition.

# Path which defines the location of the suplimentary cooking scripts such
# as RunA1C and RunCC_mon.

CLAS_SCRIPTS /work/clas/pdisk4/clarisse/pass0/v1/scripts/

# Path to bin directory for analysis executables. It is not necessary to 
# specify the operating system after the bin directory. The operating 
# system Linux or SunOS will be added in RunJob depending on what farm 
# system the job is running on.

CLAS_BIN /work/clas/pdisk4/clarisse/pass0/v1/bin/

# Path to the Perl offline database.

CLAS_DB /work/clas/pdisk4/clarisse/pass0/v1/database/

# Location of the data files on the silo

CLAS_DATA /mss/clas/g7a/data

# Path where the monitoring histograms will be written. The subdirectories 
# under this path will be in monitor/ and then the name of the executable. 
# For pid histograms the standard is CLAS_OUT_PATH/monitor/pid_mon. You 
# only need to specify the path to the directory containing monitor. Then 
# make sure the directories exist for the monitoring programs that you 
# have chosen.

CLAS_OUT_PATH /work/clas/pdisk4/clarisse/pass0/v1/

# Path where the cooked files, the filtered files and the ntuples will be 
# written. Due to the size of these files they are typically written to 
# the tape silo. Under this directory the files will be placed in 
# directories CLAS_TAPE_PATH/cooked, CLAS_TAPE_PATH/Kaons,
# CLAS_TAPE_PATH/physfilter and CLAS_TAPE_PATH/ntuples respectively.
# An internal check in the cooking scripts will decide whether a jput is needed,
# so this path can be set to a work disk.

CLAS_TAPE_PATH /work/clas/pdisk4/clarisse/pass0/v1/

# Path to the location of the calibration map directory

# Filter for the file extensions which need to be cooked. Two possible 
# usages are shown. In the first only the A00 and A01 files are 
# chosen. The extensions must be separated by colon punctuation mark. 
# In the second example any file in the data directory that exists for that run 
# be processed.
