                        How to Use jlab.cshrc

To set up the offline software environment, you execute the following
command:

  source /group/clas/builds/PRODUCTION/packages/cms/jlab.cshrc

Most people do this in their .cshrc file. The default is to use the
PRODUCTION build.

Since this is quite a mouthful, in this note I will omit the path name, so the
command above will be written as

  source jlab.cshrc

Even though typing this literally will not work in general.

Quick Start: Using Command Arguments
------------------------------------

The script accepts an optional command argument so that

  source jlab.cshrc PRODUCTION

or simply

  source jlab.cshrc

will point your environment to the current production build, and

  source jlab.cshrc DEVELOPMENT

will point to the development build. In addition,

  source jlab.cshrc release-1-14

will point you to the release-1-14 build, even if it is not PRODUCTION
or DEVELOPMENT.

What the Script Does
--------------------

The script is sensitive to two environment variables and one optional
command line argument. The user need not set either variable if the
defaults are accepable.

CLAS_ROOT default = /group/clas

This sets the top of the entire CLAS software tree, includes the cvs
repository and the CLAS_PARMS area. The default should be acceptable
to most users at JLab.

CLAS_BUILD default = $CLAS_ROOT/builds/PRODUCTION

This is the complete path name of the top of the particular build that
will be used.

The optional command argument can be used to modify the definitions of
the CLAS_BUILD environment variable. If the argument is not supplied,
then the script will look for an existing definition of CLAS_BUILD. If
the variable is not set, and no argument is supplied the default value
is used.  To summarize, the order of precedence is:

  precedence   source of definition
  ----------   --------------------
  high         command line argument
  middle       pre-set environment variable
  low          default

So, to get the defaults, the variables must be unset. If you need to,
you can do this explicitly, for example:

  unsetenv CLAS_BUILD

To check whether or not CLAS_BUILD is defined:

  echo $CLAS_BUILD

Finally, the rest of the CLAS environment variables will be defined to
point to the appropriate locations under CLAS_BUILD.  For example,
CLAS_LIB will be set to $CLAS_BUILD/lib.

Examples (executed on ifarml1):

1)  No command argument, no previous definition of CLAS_BUILD

  source jlab.cshrc

gives:

  CLAS_BUILD=/group/clas/builds/PRODUCTION
  CLAS_LIB=/group/clas/builds/PRODUCTION/lib/Linux
  CLAS_BIN=/group/clas/builds/PRODUCTION/bin/Linux
  CLAS_PACK=/group/clas/builds/PRODUCTION/packages
  CLAS_CMS=/group/clas/builds/PRODUCTION/packages/cms
  CLAS_SCRIPTS=/group/clas/builds/PRODUCTION/packages/scripts

2)  With a command argument, no previous definition of CLAS_BUILD

2a)

  source jlab.cshrc DEVELOPMENT

gives:

  CLAS_BUILD=/group/clas/builds/DEVELOPMENT
  CLAS_LIB=/group/clas/builds/DEVELOPMENT/lib/Linux
  CLAS_BIN=/group/clas/builds/DEVELOPMENT/bin/Linux
  CLAS_PACK=/group/clas/builds/DEVELOPMENT/packages
  CLAS_CMS=/group/clas/builds/DEVELOPMENT/packages/cms
  CLAS_SCRIPTS=/group/clas/builds/DEVELOPMENT/packages/scripts

2b)

  source jlab.cshrc release-1-14

gives:

  CLAS_BUILD=/group/clas/builds/release-1-14
  CLAS_LIB=/group/clas/builds/release-1-14/lib/Linux
  CLAS_BIN=/group/clas/builds/release-1-14/bin/Linux
  CLAS_PACK=/group/clas/builds/release-1-14/packages
  CLAS_CMS=/group/clas/builds/release-1-14/packages/cms
  CLAS_SCRIPTS=/group/clas/builds/release-1-14/packages/scripts

3)  No command argument, with a definition of CLAS_BUILD

  setenv CLAS_BUILD /home/user/clas	
  source jlab.cshrc

gives:

  CLAS_BUILD=/home/user/clas
  CLAS_LIB=/home/user/clas/lib/Linux
  CLAS_BIN=/home/user/clas/bin/Linux
  CLAS_PACK=/home/user/clas/packages
  CLAS_CMS=/home/user/clas/packages/cms
  CLAS_SCRIPTS=/home/user/clas/packages/scripts

if you are logged into a Linux box.
