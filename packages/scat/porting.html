<h1>Porting SCAT to another platform </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The SCAT library is based upon ONC RPC. The O'Reilly book "Power RPC
Programming" provides all the reference that is needed to change/add to
SCAT. This should be portable to other flavors of RPC. The library
seeks to be simple to use and general enough to be useful. Serveral
routines are linked together on both sides of a communications (comm)
partnership. The SCAT library does not have to be used in a
client/server model. But client/server is simple to understand and
will be used with the example programs. The SCAT library provides
functions to establish comm connections with other SCAT processes
running on the network. After a connection is established the programs
can send information bidirectionally. The current implementation has
been adapted to send arrays of data in a simple manner. The client
program is simple to create. It justs sends a message and may wait for
a response from some server. Using the SCAT library the client program
looks like:
<p>
<pre>
   ...
   char bfr [1024];
   Scat_Initialize (bfr);
   handle = Scat_LocateProgram ("the.name.of.the.program");
   /*
    * send one and don't wait.
    */
   Scat_SendMsgNr (handle, "some message string");
   /*
    * now, send one and wait.
    */
   Scat_SendMsg (handle, "query the_list 1");
   ... 
</pre>
The server program is more difficult. In order for the SCAT library to
be general purpose a limit to the amount of code the library actually
supplies was made. ONC RPC (and RPC in general) puts a very small demand
upon the host program. The typical server program would spin in a loop
checking for any in coming messages and process them as they
arrive. The RPC protocol compiler generates object modules that must
be linked into your server code and should be called once in a
while. SCAT provides a simple interface to these generated RPC
protocol routines. The user must write or provide 6 functions for the
current implementation of scat to run. See the examples for more info.

<h1>Porting SCAT</h1>
<p>
To port the SCAT library to a new platform follow this process:
<p>
<ol>
<li>make sure the file j.x is present.
<li>make sure you save a copy of j_svc.c first.
<li>rpcgen j.x.
<li>recompile libscat.a
<li>recompile your application and test.
</ol>
<p>
<h2>Things to watch out for:</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>after rpcgen the file j.h needs the variable IVER set equal to
33. The number 33 is how the SCAT library identifies other scat
processes in the rpc.portmapper.
<li>rpcgen never gets the client and server function names
correct. It is VERY important that the client and server names be
just a little bit different or else the linker will complete the wrong
addresses when you try and build your application. All modules that
will be in the server have _svc appended to the end of the name (the
hp and sun and aix rpcgen's do this wrong, linux does it
correctly). For example, this is what you get from rpcgen:
<pre>
extern Event *msgwreply_1();
</pre>
If you have rpcgen create the client side stubs you'll see that this
matches. If you have rpcgen generate the server side stubs you see you
need the _svc appendage (Hp, Aix, Sun and linux all do it wrong - I
must not be using a rpcgen flag correctly somewhere). The stubb in the
file j_clnt.c looks like the above. This is what I use to separate the
server (and add in the file j.h, in the file j_svc.c I extend the
function names referenced in the switch statement) from client:
<pre>
extern Event *msgwreply_1();
extern Event *msgwreply_1_svc();
</pre>
Remember, both server and client rpc generated functions are in
libscat.a. In order for the application to work the correct stuff must
be linked on each side.  
<li>The sun rpcgen will place a lot of extra
functions in the file j_svc.c that are not used. I only keep 1
function from rpcgen (for any platform): evtsvc_inp_1(). Make sure
evtsvc_inp_1 is NOT declared static. The function evtsvc_inp_1 is
linked to global functions inside of the RPC library. The Hp, AIX,
and Linux versions of rpcgen are more resonable. They generate an
extra main function that is not needed. The tool rpcgen is oriented
toward very simple RPC systems where the server is stand alone and
does nothing else.
</ul>
<p>
Why would you want to save a copy of j_svc.c? If you look inside the
orginal copy of this file
you see that most of the case statements inside the C language switch
statement just execute a function call and drop through to the bottom
of the file and return something. One case statement
only returns an integer AND it sends the return message before it
calls the function. I do the send of the return message first so
that the RPC machinery is happy. This must be implemented before
message with no reply will work correctly. BUT the library can be
tested without change right after rpcgen is run (and the above edits
are made).
<p>
Sometimes rpcgen generates code that your compiler may not like (does
this on linux with gcc 2.7.2 so go figure) - check each message and
make sure its just complaining and not erroring. Make sure you don't
try to use source code generated for another platform on your box -
strange things work and don't work together. If in doubt, use rpcgen
again.

<h1>Doing more ...</h1>
<p>
In general sending a CLAS physics event around the network consists of
sending enough information that the event can be placed back into a
BOS/FPACK format on the receiving side. With SCAT, you don't have to
use the data in BOS format but with a call to Scat_Filter2Bos the
incoming data is inserted into the array you have previously
initialized BOS with. If you use BOS/FPACK you can skip the next
paragraph (Remember to drop all banks in the BOS array before every
call to Scat_Filter2Bos).
<p>
If you don't want to use BOS/FPACK then you need to be aware of the
size and order of the data (in the case of an array). RPC will
correctly send 16 bit quantites only if you tell it correctly. The
standard integer on most machines is 32 bits today. So, what does this
mean? The default is to send all data as integers/floats which are the
same size in ONC RPC. If your data are not one of the standard sizes
(which correspond to raw data banks: SC, EC, CC, DC & integers) then
you should use the protocol language to create a structure for it in
the file j.x.
<p>
The data is sent by the caller of Scat_SendMsg and lands on the
destination machine in the correct byte ordering and in the correct
array order - all set to process! Any data that is sent is first
wrapped up in a SCAT package or packet. The RPC protocol generation
tool (rpcgen) is used to create this packet. The packet consists of
two parts: a ascii string and a physics event. The event is
represented as an array of one or more BOS banks or fortran common
blocks or C language arrays.
<p>
To achieve this magic, the data is "packed" from a RPC
standpoint. Packing the data means to associate a RPC representation
scheme (the data is an array of integers, for example) with your
data. This scheme will be applied (read this, a copy into the RPC cloud
before a copy to the network cloud!) should you actually send your data
(but not before!!!!).
</hr>
<p>
<hr>
The subject of packing leads to the subject of implementation. ONC RPC
will correctly translate any data that is sent between different
machine byte orderings. This is done by creating a RPC protocol
specification and compiling this into your source code. The tool
rpcgen can be used to create the specification file from an input
file. In SCAT, j.x is the specification file. This file is compiled
into the files j.h, j_svc.c, j_clnt.c, j_xdr.c by rpcgen. Inspection
of the file j.x will reveal that all of the data structures that make
up the physics event part of the SCAT packet are dynamic in size
(read, created at run time). The routines in spack.c will correctly
allocate the needed memory.
<p>
At this point lets jump to the makefile before we put the whole thing
together. The makefile shows us that some files in the SCAT library
interface are linked with different sides of the SCAT comm link.
<p>
<pre>
#
SERVOBJS = j_svc.o j_xdr.o active.o reg.o svt.o
#
CLNTOBJS = j_clnt.o j_xdr.o scat.o spack.o sinfo.o lst.o evout.o svt.o
#
</pre>
<p>
NOTICE, the objects svt.o and j_xdr.o are common to both sides. More
details are needed...
<p>
Lets look at the EventStore makefile to see how a client and server
link. The client is one stand alone process to unix. The server is
another. They both compile/link with the SCAT library.
<pre>
...
#
CLIBS        = -L$(SCATDIR) -lscat
SLIBS        = -L$(SCATDIR) -lscat
#
SOBJS        = isvc.o printevent.o msvc.o config.o \
	eserror.o bnode.o dynary3.o esobj.o lstobj.o \
	parsestr.o director.o
COBJS        = clnt.o printevent.o evout.o parsestr.o

EventStore: $(SOBJS) 
	$(CC++) $(CFLAGS) -o $@  $(SOBJS) $(SLIBS)  

client : $(COBJS) 
	$(CC++) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $(COBJS) $(CLIBS) 
...
</pre>
<p>
The SOBJS target corresponds to the software linked into the server
side of the application. The COBJS target contains the client
side. The server will link both the SOBJS and the routines in
SERVOBJS. The client will link in CLNTOBJS as needed.
