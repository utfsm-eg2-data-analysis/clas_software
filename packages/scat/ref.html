<h1>Simple Communications ATtachment Reference Manual</h1>

This document only explains what the functions that make up the 
SCAT library do - not how put them together for an application.  Information
of this type is found in the SCAT Users Guide.<p>
In general the SCAT library can be divided into 2 major parts: routines for 
a producer of events and routines for a consumer of events.<p>
This manual contains the following sections:<p>
Pack events for transmission.<p>
Register a SCAT service to the network.<p>
Transmit events and messages.<p>
Probe the network for SCAT processes.<p>
Establish connections to other SCAT processes.<p>
Calls used for embedding the SCAT library into existing applications.<p>
BOS delivery of SCAT Events.<p>

<h2>Event Packing.</h2>
In order to transmit event data in a machine independent way the data needs 
to be packaged.  This packaging will handle any architectural differences 
between machines such that the bytes with in a machine word are
positioned in memory properly. In general, data that contains integer
(and floating point data) are very trivial to package. Data that
contains short integer (16 bit vs 32 bit) are more difficult to
handle. The SCAT library currently supports all CLAS BOS Banks (that
are known to the ber program) automatically. There are calls in the
library that will allow a user to define their own packaging
algorithms (and as these algorithms are tested and proven they can be
incorporated into the SCAT library).<p>

<h3>Scat_Pack - This routine takes your data and packages it for
transmission.</h3><p>
<b>C language:</b><p>int Scat_Pack (name, format, recNo, rows, cols, size,
pi)<P>
char *name - c string BOS bank name.<p>
char *format - c string BOS bank format.<p>
int recNo - the BOS record number.<p>
int rows - the number of rows of data.<p>
int cols - the number of columns of data.<p>
int size - the number of words of data.<p>
int *pi - pointer to the data.<p>
The size parameter must reflect the length of the data. For example,
if you want to send 5 short integers: size=5. If you want to send 5
integers then size still equal 5.<p>

<b>Fortran language:</b><p>scat_pack_ (name, format, rn, rows, cols, size,
pi, iret, nl, fl)<p>
The name, format and pi parameters are the same as the C language
binding.<p>
int *iret - the Fortran return code.<p>
int nl - the length of the name string.<p>
int fl - the length of the format string.<p>

<h3>Scat_PackedCount - answer the number of banks currently
packed.</h3><p>
<b>C Language:</b><p>Scat_PackedCount ()<p>
This routine takes no input parameters and returns an integer.<p>

<h3>Scat_AsPacked - answer the current packing buffer in a format ready
for transmission.</h3><p>
<b>C language:</b><p>int Scat_AsPacked (pe)<p>
Event *pe - a pointer to the packed Event (ready for transmission).<P>
There is no Fortran binding. Typically, the user will just pack the
event up and call some form of Scat_Sendxxx.<p>
<h3>Scat_PackInit - initialize the packing algorithm.</h3><p>

<b>C language:</b><p>int Scat_PackInit ()<p>
This routine answers 1 if the packer was initialized properly.<p>

<b>Fortran:</b><p>void scat_packinit_(iret)<p>
int *iret - the Fortran return code.<p>

<h3>Scat_PackForget - drop and free up memory for the current packed
event.</h3><p>

<b>C language:</b><p>int Scat_PackForget (pe)<p>
Event *pe - free memory associated with currently packed event. In
addition, the caller can free memory for a previously aquired event
(from Scat_AsPacked).<p>
<b>Fortran:</b><p>void scat_forget_()<p>Drop the event that is
currently being packed.<p>

<h2>Register a SCAT service to the network</h2><p>
All SCAT services need to be registered with the network.<p>
<b>Scat_Register - register the service with the network.</b><p>

<b>C language:</b><p>int Scat_Register (pgm_name)<p>
char *pgm_name - c string that contains the name of the program to
register. For example: Scat_Register (recsis) will register a program
named recsis to the network.<p>

<b>Fortran:</b><p>void scat_register_(name, iret, nameLength)<p>
char *name - program name.<p>
int *iret - Fortran return code.<p>
int nameLength - length of the name string.<p>

<h2>Transmit Events/Send messages</h2><p>
There are a number of routines to send data/commands/Events around the
network. The name of the function is used to indicate what each of
these functions return. Any function with *Nr* (as in Scat_SendEvtNr)
in the name returns void. Here is a list of functions:<p>

Scat_SendMsgNr<p>
Scat_SendEvtNr<p>
Scat_SendMsg<p>
Scat_SendEvt2Lst<p>

<h3>Scat_SendMsgNr - send a message/command with no reply.</h3><p>
The no reply is something of a lie - all Scat_Sendxxx routines receive
a reply of some kind. The routines that don't get a reply actually
receive a meaningless integer as a reply. The receiving server will
send back the (meaningless) reply and then process the data in the
message.<p>

<b>C language:</b><p>int Scat_SendMsgNr (handle, message)<p>
int handle - the handle returned from Scat_InitHandle.<p>
char *message - the message to be processed by the receiving
service.<p>
<b>Fortran:</b><p>void scat_sendmsgnr (handle, message, iret,
mlen)<p>
int *handle - pointer to the handle returned from scat_inithandle_.<p>
char *message - message to process.<p>
int *iret - Fortran return code.<p>
int mlen - the length of the message string.<P>

<h3>Scat_SendEvtNr - transmit a packed event across the network.</h3><p>
Send a packed event across the network. This function returns void.<p>
<b>C language:</b><p>int Scat_SendEvtNr (handle, message)<p>
int handle - the handle returned by Scat_InitHandle.<p>
char *message - a command to send (see the EventStore users guide for
details on the content of these commands).<p>
<b>Fortran:</b><p>void scat_sendevtnr_ (handle, message, iret,
mlen)<p>
int *handle - handle return from scat_inithandle.<p>
char *message - descriptive text (See EventStore Users Guide).<p>
int *iret - Fortran return code.<p>
int mlen - length of the message string.<p>

<h3>Scat_SendMsg - send a message/command and receive an event from the
server.</h3><p>
<b>C language:</b><p>Event *Scat_SendMsg (handle, message)<p>
int handle - returned from Scat_InitHandle.<p>
char *message - message text to be processed by a server.<p>

<h3>Scat_SendEvt2Lst - transmit a packed event to an EventStore list.</h3><p>
Send a packed event to a specific list inside an EventStore
object. This is a function to make a common task simple.<p>
<b>C language:</b><p>int Scat_SendEvt2Lst (handle, listName)<p>
int handle - the handle returned by Scat_InitHandle.<p>
char *listName - the list in an EventStore to send this packed event
to (See EventStore Users Guide for details on lists).<p>
<b>Fortran:</b><p>void scat_sendevt2lst_ (handle, listName, iret,
llen)<p>
int *handle - handle return from scat_inithandle.<p>
char *listName - name of an EventStore list (See EventStore Users Guide).<p>
int *iret - Fortran return code.<p>
int llen - length of the listName string.<p>

<h3>Scat_BrowCreate - Create a browser interface.</h3><p>
This routine is used between the EventStore and an Browser (like ced)
to create an efficient interface into the EventStore (see the
EventStore users guide for more detail).<p>
<b>C language:</b><p>int Scat_BrowCreate (handle, message)<p>
int handle - returned from Scat_InitHandle.<p>
char *message - See EventStore users guide for message content.<p>

<h3>Scat_BrowDestroy - Destroy a browser interface.</h3><p>
To save memory when a browser dies it should destroy its interface to
the EventStore.
<b>C language:</b><p>int Scat_BrowDestroy (handle, message)<p>
int handle - returned from Scat_InitHandle.<p>
char *message - see the EventStore users guide.<p>

<h3>Scat_BrowFilter - main browser interface routine.</h3><p>
A browser sends commands like "next", "previous" and "top" through
this interface. The EventStore users guide has more detail.<p>
<b>C language:</B><p>Event * Scat_Browfilter (handle, message)
int handle - returned from Scat_InitHandle.<p>
char *message - see EventStore users guide.<p>

<h2>Probe the network for SCAT processes.</h2><p>
A number of routines are provided to gather information about other
SCAT processes available on the network. Mostly, these routines are
used by consumer type processes (ced, and other GUI's) that wish to
query or control a SCAT process.
<h3>Scat_Probe - probe a host for SCAT processes.</h3><p>
<b>C language:</b><p>char ** Scat_Probe (hostname)<p>
char *hostname - the name of the host to query.<p>
This routine returns an array of pointers to strings. These strings
contain enough information to allow a user to connect to a SCAT
process.<p>

<h3>Scat_LocateProgram - Locate a program (by name) on a host.</h3><p>
The caller supplies a string for the host to probe and a string for
the program name to locate on that host. If the program name is found
the routine returns a handle to that (host, program) pair. This
routine can be called many times. For any one (host, program) pair the
scat library maintains only 1 handle. This routine returns that handle.<p>
<b>C language:</b><p>int Scat_LocateProgram (hostname, programName)<p>
char *hostname - name of the host where service resides.<p>
char *programName - the name of the scat process that is set in
Scat_Register.<p> 
<b>Fortran:</b><p>
char *hostname - name of the host where service resides.<p>
char *programName - the name of the scat process that is set in
int  *iret - fortran return code.<p>
int  hostNameLength - number of character in hostname.<p>
int  programNameLength - number of character in programName.<p>

<h3>Scat_ServerProbe - answer information about a specific SCAT
process.</h3><p>
<b>C language:</b><p>char *Scat_ServerProbe (hostname, programNumber,
versionNumber)<p>
char *hostname - name of the host where service resides.<p>
unsigned long programNumber - supplied by Scat_InitHandle or Scat_Probe.<p>
unsigned long versionNumber - supplied by Scat_InitHandle or Scat_Probe.<p>

<h3>Scat_ServerInfo - answer information about a specific
server.</h3><p>
<b>C language:</b><p>char *Scat_ServerInfo (handle)<p>
int handle - returned from Scat_InitHandle.<p>

<h2>Establish connections with another SCAT process.</h2><p>
In order to communicate with other SCAT processes on the network a
connection with the SCAT process must be established. These routines
currently are something of a scam as they only store the input
parameters for use by other SCAT library calls. This could change in
the future and therefore these routines should be used.<p>

<h3>Scat_InitHandle - create a handle to another SCAT process. Return
a handle that can be used by the other SCAT library calls.</h3><p>
<b>C language:</b><p>int Scat_InitHandle (hostname, programNumber,
versionNumber)<p>
char *hostname - the name of the host where the SCAT process you would
like to connect to lives.<p>
unsigned long programNumber - supplied by Scat_Probe.<p>
unsigned long versionNumber - supplied by Scat_Probe.<p>
<b>Fortran:</b><p>void scat_inithandle_(hostname, programNumber,
versionNumber, hlen)<p>
char *hostname - hostname where SCAT process lives.<p>
unsigned long *programNumber - supplied by scat_probe_.<p>
unsigned long *versionNumber - supplied by scat_probe_.<p>
int hlen - length of the hostname string.<p>

<h3>Scat_HandHost - return the hostname for this handle.</h3><p>
This routine will answer the hostname associated with a handle.<p>
<b>C language:</b><p>char *Scat_HandHost (handle)<p>
int handle - supplied by Scat_Probe.<p>

<h3>Scat_HandProgram - return the program number for this handle.</h3><p>
This routine will answer the programNumber associated with a handle.<p>
<b>C language:</b><p>char *Scat_HandProgram (handle)<p>
int handle - supplied by Scat_Probe.<p>

<h3>Scat_HandVers - return the version number for this handle.</h3><p>
This routine will answer the version number associated with a handle.<p>
<b>C language:</b><p>char *Scat_HandVers (handle)<p>
int handle - supplied by Scat_Probe.<p>

<h2>Embedding the SCAT library into existing applications</h2><p>
The SCAT library can be embedded into an existing application. The
application must periodically call Scat_Active to service the network
connection.
<h3>Scat_Active - poll the network connection for data to
process.</h3><p>
<b>C language:</b><p>void Scat_Active ()<p>
<b>Fortran:</b><p>void scat_active_ ()<p>

<h2>BOS delivery of SCAT Event data.</h2><p>
The SCAT library provides a native BOS delivery scheme. By calling
Scat_Filter2Bos the application can use BOS features to manipulate and
retrieve physics event data. At the moment the application must drop
all banks from any physics events currently contained in the BOS
before calling Scat_Filter2Bos.<p>
<h3>Scat_Filter2Bos - deliver Event data into BOS array.</h3><p>
<b>C language:</b><p>int Scat_Filter2Bos (handle, msg, piw, iw_size)<p>
int handle - supplied by Scat_Probe.<p>
char * msg - see EventStore Users guide.<p>
int  * piw - point to the BOS array.<p>
int    iw_size - size of BOS array in words.<p>
