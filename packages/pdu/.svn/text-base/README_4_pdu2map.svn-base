DISCLAIMER:  This is a quick and dirty way to make
an executable for pdu2map - unaesthetic, but if you
are in a hurry ........     /SP 12-07-00/

(a) Make sure to add the header file 'pdu2map.h' in 
    pdu2map.cc; ie '#include <pdu2map.h>'.

(b) Use the makefile Makefile_4_pdu2map.

(c) 'make pdu2map' gives you an executable.
