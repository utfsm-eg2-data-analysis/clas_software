For example of  CALDB Java-interface run the Caldbjview.bat script

setup java in CUE:
>setup java

check out the code (packages/caldbJ) compile and run the Calibjview

>gmake
>Caldbjview.bat [host] [dbase]
host and dbase are optional, their default values are clasdb and calib.


To get the set of constants (button Constants) choose the system,subsystem,item
define the RunIndex table name (default RunIndex) the upper limit on 
date of production (default 2037-1-1 for Date) and the run number
(default 28000 for Runno ).
A window with a histogram of choosed constant set will appear.

For Time Graph type dependence (button Time Graph) choose 
the  system,subsystem,item and channel#,
define  RunIndex table name, Date and the run range  ( RunMin< run# < RunMax) 
A display window with  constant vs run# will appear in addition to
the list of values.

The Graph with difference is giving a distribution of differences
of corresponding calibration constants ( system,subsystem,item)
for 2 runs, run#=RunMin and run#=RunMax.


Graphic support, is based on JAS package.
