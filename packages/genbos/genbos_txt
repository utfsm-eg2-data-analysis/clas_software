			THE CODE
			--------

-PHYSICS
This Monte Carlo code describes photoreactions on free 
nucleons and on deuterons for photon energy from pion 
production threshold up to 10 GeV. The code describes 
in a phenomenological way 31 different reaction channels, 
generating hadronic events with nucleons, pions and light 
mesons in the final state. Both the resonant and non 
resonant contributions are taken into account.
For each hadronic event, the program:
1) select a reaction channel, depending on total cross 
   sections of all selected ones;
2) generates the kinematical quantities of final particles,
   according of tabulated differential cross sections for
   two-body channels or through the CERN routine GENBOD for
   multi-body channels and checking for conservation of 
   tetramomenta;
3) takes into account delta and rho decaying, if needed;
4) performs the LAB to CM system transformations, if needed.

-COMPUTER
The code was originally developed for VMS machines. Now, 
it was installed also on a Unix machine with Linux platform.
A BOS interface was also developed, in order to use its 
output as input file for GSIM.
The code consists of some tenth of fortran routines with few 
include files. It can be compiled with its makefile, and the 
executable file named 'genbos' run with the input file 
'genbos.in'.
It needs only the standard CERN libraries, like PAW, HBOOK, 
and so on, and CLAS BOS libraries.

		GAMMA-NUCLEON INTERACTIONS
		--------------------------

-TWO-BODY CHANNELS
The code takes into account 9 two-body channels both on 
proton and neutron, including channels with production of 
barionic (delta) resonances and scalar (eta) or vector 
mesons (rho and omega). Due to their small life time, delta 
and rho decay into N-pi and pi-pi channels, respectively. 
For each channels, both total and differential cross section 
are calculated from a phenomenological analisys of 
experimental data.

 21           gamma p --->  omega  p 
 22           gamma n --->  omega  n 


-MANY-BODY CHANNELS
At high energy, at least few tenths of channels opens, a 
lot of these not measurables. So, they are described 
appling statistical relations in the isospin space from 
knowed channels, kept as reference channels. Using this 
method, channels with up to 8 pions in the final state 
are taken in account.

 27           gamma p --->  (4-8)pi N 
 28           gamma n --->  (4-8)pi N 

-EXPERIMENTAL CHECKS
The gamma-nucleon code gives in output hadronic events with 
a nucleon, pions and light mesons (eta and omega, since rho 
decays into pions). The results of the generator have been
extensively checked comparing total cross sections, number 
of generated particles and their distributions with 
experimental data. 
With respect to results of Ref. [1], only few improvements 
have been done. 
1) a new fit of experimental data of total cross section for 
gamma n --> p rho-, from wich also the gamma p --> n rho+ 
cross section can be obtained via isospin relations;
2) a better separation of resonant (rho0) and non resonant
contribution to pi+pi- production on neutron.
For any other detailed information, see Ref. [1].


		GAMMA-DEUTERONS INTERACTIONS
		----------------------------

-SINGLE NUCLEON REACTIONS
The 28 two-body and multi-body channels on single nucleon
are taken into account considering Fermi motion and binding 
energy  of the interacting nucleon inside the deuteron 
nucleus, while the non interacting nucleon is considered 
as a spectator. So, for these channels, the final state has 
a high energy nucleon (the interacting one), a low energy 
nucleon (the spectator one) and a number of mesons.

-SPECIAL DEUTERON CHANNELS
Three special channels have been added for gamma-deuteron 
reactions:

 No.           special deuteron channel
 33           gamma D --->  pi0  D 
 34           gamma D --->  p  n 
 35           gamma D --->  rho0  D 

For channels 33 and 35, total and differential cross sections 
are derived from phenomenological fits of experimental data.
For photodisintegration channel, at energy lower than 0.5 GeV a 
fit of experimental data with Legendre polynomial was performed
(see Ref. [2]). At higher energies, total and differential cross 
sections are calculated from a model based on Quark Gluon String
model (see Ref. [3]).

-COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA
The extension of the code to gamma-deuteron interactions is only 
a recent result. Various experimental checks have been performed 
on this new part, but the code is still under verification. The 
following simple tests have been performed:

gamma D --> pi0 X    total cross section
gamma D --> eta X    total cross section
gamma D --> p X      proton momentum distribution
gamma D --> D pi0    diff. cross section
gamma D --> D rho0   total cross section
gamma D --> p n      diff. cross section

Total and differential cross section are derived from the generator 
simply from the number of events generated for the proper reaction, 
taking as a normalization value the total cross section gamma-D, 
and compared with available experimental data.
This list above obviously does'nt complete all the possible tests 
of the deuteron generator. This is only the checks we performed, 
tacking experimental data from the web server
http://durpdg.dur.ac.uk/hepdata.
Any comment is wellcome.


		HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
		----------------------

The input file to run the program looks like this:

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
           2|   I12  | ICIBLE=0 neutron; =1 proton                       |
	    |        |       =2 deuteron            as a target          |
           2|   I12  | IBEAM=0, gaussian, =2 Bremsstrahlung =3 uniform   |

    0.300   |  F12.3 | FWHM,  width of gamma energy distribution (GeV)   |

21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 33 34 35 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
 ------------------------ end of ICHAIN ----------------------------------
       05000|   I12  | NSTATIS total number of events                    |
       10065|   I12  | IX             INITIAL SEED VALUE                 |

  .false.   |   L12  | NO_BOS_OUT  no bos out file                       |
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can choose the following options in the first column:

- the target index ICIBLE, for proton, neutron or deuteron;

- the photon energy, extracted between (ETAG-FWHM) and (ETAG+FWHM), with
  three different distributions setting IBEAM;

- the interaction vertex, setting the index TARG_TYPE
  for TARG_TYPE=0 the interaction vertex is 0
  for TARG_TYPE=1 the interaction vertex is uniformly extracted in 
	a cylinder with length TARG_L and radius TARG_R
  for TARG_TYPE=2 the interaction vertex is uniformly extracted in 
	a volume with shape like the CLAS target 'cuivre' (a 
	cylinder with a spherical endcap) with total length 
	TARG_L and radius TARG_R
  for TARG_TYPE=3 the interaction vertex is uniformly extracted in 
	a volume with shape like the CLAS target 'cigare' (a 
	cylinder with two spherical endcaps) with total length 
	TARG_L and radius TARG_R

- the reference system for outgoing particles, setting CMSF
	.false. --> laboratory system, in wich target is at rest
	.true.  --> center of mass of photon-target system

- the active reaction channels, setting in the ICHAIN vector index the
  corresponding channel number from the list above. For instance,
  if you are interested in the rho0 photoproduction on deuteron,
  you can select only the channels 11,14 and 35 setting	

	35 11 14 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
	00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
	
  The only important limitations are that 40 numbers must be fed
  putting the rigth numbers of 00 and that no 00 must be put 
  between selected channel numbers.

- the number NSTATIS of hadronic events to be generated, keeping in mind
  that a run with 150000 events takes 2-4 Gb for the HBOOK file and 
  7-10 Gb for the BOS file (see below) and that the speed is about
  1M of events/hour on a intel Pentium II 300 MHz processor

- the output files: setting TRUE the variable NO_BOS_OUT (NO_NT_OUT) 
  the BOS (RZN) file will not be created (see below).


			OUTPUT FILES
			------------

The output of the generator consists of three files.
- a log-file 'out_log_xx.log' where xx is the run number, with the input 
  parameters;
- a BOS file 'out_BOS_xx.evt' with kinematical quantities of generated
  particles, directly readable from GSIM;
- a HBOOK file 'out_nt_xx.rzn' with a column wise ntuple containing the 
  following variables:

  BLOCK evnt: GENERAL OF EVENT
	nev	NUMBER OF EVENT
	efot	PHOTON ENERGY
	nreac	REACTION CHANNEL
	vx
	vy	INTERACTION POINT
	vz
  BLOCK finst: FINAL STATE PARTICLES

	idg	GEANT PARTICLE ID
	idr	LUND PARTICLE ID
	qch	CHARGE
	mass	MASS (GeV)
	imp	MOMENTUM (GeV)
	cx
	cy	DIRECTION COSINES
	cx
  BLOCK prim: PRIMARY INTERACTION, BEFORE DECAYING
	np1	NUMBER OF PRIMARY PARTICLES
	idg1	GEANT PARTICLE ID

	qch1	CHARGE
	mass1	MASS (GeV)
	imp1	MOMENTUM (GeV)
	cx1
	cy1	DIRECTION COSINES
	cx1


			FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
			-------------------

As previously pointed out, the gamma-deuteron part is still under
verification, but we hope that not too big new modifications will
be needed.
The original VMS code includes also a gamma-nucleus generator (see 
Ref. [1]). The intra-nuclear cascade model takes into account 
rescattering and absorption in the nucleus of pions, nucleons and 
mesons generated in the elementary gamma-nucleon reaction. The 
evaporation, fission and multifragmentation of highly excited 
residual nucleus is also taken into account. This part is still to 
install on Unix, and the BOS interface is to develope.
