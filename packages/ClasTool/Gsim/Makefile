# NOTES:
#
# SRC_CLASS: contains the source files (*.cc) of the CLASSES. A dictionary is made.
# SRC_FILES: contains the source files (*.cc) for the FUNCTIONS and PROGRAMS. No dictionary.
# INC_FILES: contains include files. This is only used to detect if we need to remake the Makefile_depends.
#
# The depends file will only be used if you keep the last include: 'include Makefile_depends'
# This scheme will still try to generate one (in Makefile_bottom).
