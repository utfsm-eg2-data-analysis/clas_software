This package is in development stage and does not contain
all functionality that it needs. 
Only function implemented is GetBeamEnergy.

from mySQL maps.


Requirements
------------

-  mySQL database
-  ROOT (version 2.23 or higher)
-  TMySQL library which can be downloaded separately from 
   ROOT home page 

Note: TMySQL does not come with ROOT you need to download it
      and compile.


Instalation
-----------

In order to compile this package You need to have
mySQL installed on your system and enviromental variables set up
to point "lib" and "include" directories where mysql include files
and libraries can be found.

example:
on JLAB CUE machines use

>setenv MYSQL_LIBS     /apps/mysql/lib/mysql
>setenv MYSQL_INCLUDE  /apps/mysql/include/mysql

if You have all this set up just type make from 
prompt and libMapTools.so will appear in your
